Exercises


1. What is the main difference between a stack and a queue?
    A: The order is processed in a stack LIFO and a queue as FIFO

2. What are the similarities between stacks and queues?
    A: They both are data structures that handle requests and manipulate the order data is accessed.

3. Imagine you are an engineer tasked with implementing the UNDO and REDO options in a word processor such as Microsoft Word. Which data structure would you use for each option and why?
    A: For this I would use a stack as it would remove the last letter,  and will store them in an array, then for redo would use a stack again  since this require FIFO 
Programming Questions


You may program the following question in any language of your choice. Before you begin coding, write out a plan as to how you will solve the question.

1. Given a string, reverse it using a stack. For example, the string "Bloc!" should be converted to "!colB".
    A: store the characters of the string in an array/stack one by one, then pop them  to a new string. this will start the string with the last character.

    var reverse = (string)=>{
        let stack = [];
        for (var i = 0; i<string.length; i++){
         stack.push(string.charAt(i));
        }
		while (!stack.length == 0){
		newString +=stack.pop();
        }
	    return newString;
    }


2. Implement the delete functionality of a stack using one queue. Make a FIFO data structure mirror the functionality of a LIFO data structure.

    To delete an item, take all of the elements in the queue one at a time and put them at the end of the queue, except for the last one which should be deleted and returned.

CLASS Stack
 FUNCTION pop(queue)
    SET the length of the queue to var length 
    LOOP through the array from array[0] to array[length-1]
    SET temp to the last element array[length-1
    REMOVE temp
 END FUNCTION
END CLASS


3. Fill in the methods for the following Queue class so that it will work as expected (FIFO).

CLASS QUEUE
 FUNCTION enqueue(element)
   SET array[length] = element
 END FUNCTION

 FUNCTION dequeue
   SET array[length-1] to var dequeueValue
   SET array[length-1] to NULL
   RETURN dequeueValue
 END FUNCTION
END CLASS
