Short Answer

1.Why do programmers use pseudocode?
    A: Is at the end of the day an  aid to help programmers sort trough the logic of an algorithm without using a specific language syntax.

2.If you run pseudocode on your computer what would happen?
    A: either nothing or an error, since is not a programming language.

Programming Assignment

Write the following algorithms in pseudocode:

1. Create a function that takes two numbers and prints out the greater number.
    
    return largest
        if number 1 not equal number 2
            if number1 bigger than number2
                return number1
            else 
                return number2
        end if
    end

2. Create a function that prints out the numbers from 1 to 100.

    print 1 to 100
        for i start in 1 to 100 by 1
            print i and go to new line
        end for
    end

3. Create a function that searches for a specific entry in a phonebook.

    entry in phone book

        FOR phonebook entry starting at 0 index and less than phonebook length iterate through phonebook
            IF entry is equal to phonebook item
	            PRINT ‘Entry was found! + phone number’
            END
            IF NOT entry
	            PRINT ‘entry +  is not listed!’
            END IF
        END FOR
    END
4. Using the pseudocode you wrote for the previous question, implement it in any computer language of your choice.

var phonebook = [{'name':'carla', 'number':'832-555-5555'}, {'name':'james', 'number':'713-555-5555'}, {'name':'damian', 'number':'832-555-5555'}];
    
    function phoneSearch(entry){
        for(var i = 0; i < phonebook.length; i++){
		    return entry.toLowerCase() === phonebook[i].name?`Entry was found! ${phonebook[i].number}`:`${entry} Is not listed!`;
        }
    }
